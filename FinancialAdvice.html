        <h2>Financial Help</h2>
        <p>
            One of the most stressful aspects for a first year college student is navigating their financial situation. With rising tuition costs it is important to know and utilize the resources available to you. While this is not an exhaustive list, below are a few options to help you pay for your college tuition:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>FAFSA:</strong> FAFSA is a free application for financial aid through the Department of Education. This provides an opportunity to receive money in the form of grants or student loans that will go towards tuition costs. To fill out this application you will need to go to <a href="https://studentaid.gov" target="_blank">studentaid.gov</a>, have the necessary documents on hand, and follow the steps provided on the website under the “How to fill out the FAFSA form” tab. The review process can take months at a time so it is important to fill out the application either on opening day, October 1st, or as soon as possible after that.
            </li>

                <strong>Scholarships/Grants:</strong> Scholarships and grants are another great way to help pay for tuition. Unlike student loans, grants and scholarships are money that's awarded to you that you are not required to pay back. One specific to Chemeketa is the Chemeketa Foundation Scholarship and with just one application you will be eligible for over 150 available scholarships. Applications are available February 1st through April 15th at <a href="https://chemeketa.academicworks.com" target="_blank">chemeketa.academicworks.com</a>. For other external scholarships and grants you can visit <a href="https://niche.com" target="_blank">niche.com</a>, <a href="https://scholarships.com" target="_blank">scholarships.com</a>, or <a href="https://scholarships360.org" target="_blank">scholarships360.org</a> where you can filter by major or state to find one that's right for you.

                <strong>Employment:</strong> Although this is less recommended, sometimes it’s necessary to work alongside attending school if there are gaps in your finances. Chemeketa does offer assistance in finding employment through the Career Services Center. Here you can get help with resumes and cover letters, searching for jobs, and interview preparation. You can schedule an appointment to meet with career services through the Navigate app, calling 503.399.5026, or emailing careercenter@chemeketa.edu. In addition to this, Chemeketa has a job board with various employment opportunities known as Careerlink. Here you can sign up for an account and browse many different listings for work in your area.
