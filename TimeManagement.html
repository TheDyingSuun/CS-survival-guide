    <h2>Time Management</h2>
    <p>
        As a nation, 2 out of every 3 community college students do not complete their degree within the norm of 2-3 years. Students in community college increasingly drop out due to many circumstances, this can include a lack of resources, overbearing stress, or low grades. However, there is one controllable factor students can take advantage of, their time. Managing your time correctly can influence your grades positively and reduce your workload. This can make a student’s time less stressful at college. This section will focus on time management skills that a student can hone easily.

            <strong>Study Ratio Rule:</strong> The first step is to evaluate how much time you should spend out of the classroom on coursework. The rule of thumb is that for every hour spent in class you should spend 2 hours reading or working on course material. In a more demanding class, you should bump it up to 3 hours per hour. This gives you a tangible way to plan out your schedule and make time to live a balanced life. You can achieve this with a schedule planner app or a physical calendar, but the most crucial thing is to set time aside throughout the week to study.

            <strong>Snowball Method:</strong> When feeling overwhelmed by larger assignments like essays or projects, try tackling the smaller assignments first. This will give you more confidence and build momentum to finally complete that larger-than-life assignment.

            <strong>Find the work environment that works for you:</strong> Distractions can cost you time and make you fall behind and miss assignments. At home it is easy to get distracted, so try to find a place that minimizes that. A café, the library, or at campus are great places to start.

            <strong>Do not risk burn out:</strong> This comes with managing your time but setting aside time for a break from a rough study session is crucial. Our brains need breaks after rough tasks, to process new information. The best way to utilize this is by using the <em>pomodoro technique</em>. The idea is to choose a task, set a timer for 25 minutes, take a 5-minute break once the time ends and repeat. After 4 intervals, you can take a 20-minute break.
