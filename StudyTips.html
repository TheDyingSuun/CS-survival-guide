        Study Tips
    </h2>
    <p>
        Coming into college you might find that you need to change how you study in order to stay on top of your classes. With a new environment and higher expectations it’s easy to get overwhelmed and fall behind. In order to prevent that from happening keep these study tips in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Get organized:</strong> Keep track of materials you will need to complete your work such as notes, handouts from class, and textbooks. Use properly labeled binders, notebooks, and folders for each class to hold these important materials and have easy access to them when you need. Also utilize a planner to map out when assignments are due so you have enough time to complete them and turn them in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Choose a study method:</strong> There are many ways to approach your study sessions and over time you will find the right one for you. However, these are a couple you can get started with:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Feynman technique:</strong> For this you will first need to pick the topic you wish to study. Write everything down that you can recall about the topic in as much detail as possible. Then explain the topic as if you were teaching it to someone else and assess your explanation for gaps in knowledge to correct. Repeat this process until you are confident you have truly retained the information and can explain it well.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spaced repetition:</strong> This method involves repetitive review of materials throughout the week. Start with learning the material on the first day, then review the material once each day for the next two days. Then come back to the material once a week for the next two weeks or until you feel comfortable with it.
                </li>
            </ul>

        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Avoid procrastination/cramming:</strong> Waiting until the last minute to study can cause a lot of unnecessary stress and negatively impact your academic performance. To avoid this, schedule time to study throughout the week and stick to it. It would also be useful to make a to-do list for daily studying sessions that have achievable and timely goals to reach. Finally, you should find an environment that is conducive to studying and eliminates distractions, such as the library on the second floor of building nine.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Take breaks:</strong> It can seem productive to have long, uninterrupted studying sessions to review as much material as possible. However, that can be counterproductive as long stretches of studying, without breaks, can lead to poor retention of information. Instead you should allow yourself to take breaks periodically which can help with focus, reducing stress, and mental fatigue. A good rule of thumb is to take a five to ten minute break every hour during a study session.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ask for help:</strong> If you are running into roadblocks with understanding class material, reach out to those around you. Visit your professor during their listed office hours so they can help guide you through any confusion you may have surrounding information from class. You can also schedule tutoring sessions through the Navigate app, which are hosted in the Academic Support Center in the library, for additional help if your professor is unavailable or studying on your own isn’t working out.
