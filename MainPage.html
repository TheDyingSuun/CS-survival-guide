    <h2>It's gonna be hard, but worth it.</h2>
    <content>A computer science major can be difficult. In fact, I would go so far as to say it's one of the harder majors to complete, if just because of the variety of subject matter covered. One must be proficient at math, technical writing, and often people skills. There's also a need for an engineering mindset, adaptability, and perseverance in the face of an ever changing industry. <br /> Though we may not be able to help much, we hope this little website will give you some perspective to help you succeed on your path!</content>
